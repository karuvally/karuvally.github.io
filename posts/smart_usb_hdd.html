    <h1>SMART on WD USB HDDs</h1>

    <p>I have a WD My Passport USB HDD, which me and my brother use for our
    backup. Rather than having one for each of us, we use a single HDD (Yes,
    we are cheapskates). As it changes hands between the two of us fairly
    often, we are naturally very concerned about its health.</p>

    <p>I usually use smartmontools to retrieve the SMART data of my HDDs, but
    for some reason, the default set of arguments won’t do for the WD
    Passport.</p>
    <p class="code">
    root@N148P:/home/aswin# smartctl -a /dev/sdb<br>
    smartctl 6.6 2016-05-31 r4324 [x86_64-linux-4.9.0-3-amd64] (local build)<br>

    <br>
    /dev/sdb: Unknown USB bridge [0x1058:0x259f (0x1014)]<br>
    Please specify device type with the -d option.<br>
    <br>
    Use smartctl -h to get a usage summary<br>
    </p>

    <p>For the longest amount of time, I strongly believed I would have to use
    WD’s proprietary Windows application (yikes!) to monitor the disks. But
    then, yesterday, I chanced upon <a href="https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Supported_USB-Devices">this</a> page.
    The page has an extensive set of USB devices which the tool supports along
    with special arguments, which might be needed to make them work with
    smartmontools.</p>

    <p>It turns out using the “-d sat” argument would make smartmontools play
    nice with my HDD!</p>
    <p class="code">
    root@N148P:/home/aswin# smartctl -a -d sat /dev/sdb<br>

    <p>The -d switch sets the type of our device, without letting smartmontools
    guess on its own. The set of arguments needed for your device can differ,
    so if you own a USB storage device, go look it up in the page!</p>
