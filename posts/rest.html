    <h1>Understanding REST</h1>

    <p>What is REST?<br>
    REST is a set of conventions for creating APIs which operate over
    HTTP. To put it in simpler terms, REST offers some guidelines on how
    an application and server should interact over the web.</p>
    
    <p>What does REST stand for?<br>
    Good question. REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. An
    API is said to be RESTful, if it follows the REST guidelines.</p>
    
    <p>What does the name even mean?<br>
    I found the best explanation to this question over <a href="xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html">here</a>.
    It boils down to this. A client requests a resource from a server
    (eg. CPU temperature of the server). The server then responds by
    sending back a representation of the resource that can be understood
    by the client. In the case of REST, the response should be textual in
    nature. In the above example (CPU temp), the server simply responds
    with a temperature value (eg. 50C). If the client requests an image,
    the server will respond with a URL (still text :D) leading to the
    image. Now, when a client recieves a representation from the server,
    the state of the client changes. That is, if a client requests for an
    image and receives the repsresentation (URL) leading to the image, it
    puts the client in a new state. It doesn't matter what the client
    does with the image, what matters is the fact that the client has a
    representation (URL) of the resource (image). Likewise, the client's
    state will keep on changing (transfering) for each subsequent request
    and response. Thus the name.</p>
    
    <p>An example, please?<br>
    Let's say we have an application, which monitors the health of a server.
    In this scenario, the application would be the client and the server
    would be, well, the server. Let's assume the server is available through
    the IP "192.168.1.2". To get the uptime of the host, the client could
    retrieve the URL "http://192.168.1.2/uptime" (this by the way is an
    HTTP GET method). The server could then respond with something like
    this (usually using HTTP POST method).</p>
    <p class="code">
    {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;"uptime_sec": 1223463<br>
	}
    </p>
    <p>The response here is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>
    but it can be in any format as long as it is textual (eg. YAML). Once
    the client receives the data, it does what it is programmed to do (eg.
    presenting the information in a human friendly way). Also note that
    the client can use any valid HTTP method (including POST) for communicating
    with the server.
    </p>
    
    <p>How to get started with REST?<br>
    Far wiser people have written countless articles on getting started
    with REST. You can google them. But for Python, <a href="https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/">this</a>
    article is by far the best I have seen. Before you begin, make sure to check
    out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Wikipedia</a>
    page on REST and pay attention to Architectural constraints. The REST <a href="https://restcookbook.com/">Cookbook</a>
    can help you iron out some of the niggles people face when building
    a REST API.</p>
