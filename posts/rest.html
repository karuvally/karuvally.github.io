    <h1>Quick intro to REST</h1>

    <p>What is REST?<br>
    REST is a set of conventions for creating APIs which operate over
    HTTP. To put it in simpler terms, REST offers some guidelines on how
    an application and server should interact over the web.</p>
    
    <p>What does REST stand for?<br>
    Good question. REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. An
    API is said to be RESTful, if it follows the REST guidelines.</p>
    
    <p>What does the name even mean?<br>
    I found the best explanation to this question over <a href="xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html">here</a>.
    It boils down to this. A client requests a resource from a server
    (eg. CPU temperature of the server). The server then responds by
    sending back a representation of the resource that can be understood
    by the client. In the case of REST, the response should be textual in
    nature. In the above example (CPU temp), the server simply responds
    with a temperature value (eg. 50C). If the client requests an image,
    the server will respond with a URL (still text :D) leading to the
    image. Now, when a client recieves a representation from the server,
    the state of the client changes. That is, if a client requests for an
    image and receives the repsresentation (URL) leading to the image, it
    puts the client in a new state. It doesn't matter what the client
    does with the image, what matters is the fact that the client has a
    representation (URL) of the resource (image). Likewise, the client's
    state will keep changing for each subsequent request and response. In
    other words, the state of the client transfers
