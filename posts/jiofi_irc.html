    <h1>I bought a JioFi with an inbuilt IRC Server!</h1>

	<p>At the end of last academic year, we had cut the broadband
	connection which served us in the hostel to avoid paying rent during
	vacation. It meant at the start of this year, I was without a
	working internet connection and was in the market for an ISP.</p>

	<p>If you want a cheap internet provider in India, Reliance Jio is
	hard to beat. They offer high speed 4G internet at very low price.
	Sadly My phone is not LTE capable and thus I could not just buy a
	Reliance Jio SIM and insert it into my phone.</p>

	<p>For the first couple of months, I tried using the 3G internet
	connection of the state run BSNL and had to put up with slow
	unusable internet. The connection was not expensive, but what is
	the use of 3G internet if the download speed is around 15 KiB/s?
	also, the connection came with no additional calling credits, so I
	still had to shell out extra for making calls. On top of this, the
	phone routinely refused to connect to the internet, denying me
	access when I needed it the most. By the end of second month, I
	finally came to the conclusion that I was simply wasting my money
	paying for a connection that was serving me no purpose.</p>

	<p>Few days after this, my phone started refusing to make calls. I
	skipped the prospect of buying a phone as it was expensive. I chose
	the apparently superior option of buying a JioFi router. The device
	would allow data transfer upto 1 GB per day in 4G speeds and also
	allowed unlimited voice calls. But most importantly, it was free for
	the first six months andi offered a considerably cheap subscription
	after that.</p>

	<p>I had read from some sites that it was made by an Indian brand
	called LYF and was expecting a  half baked product. I couldn’t have
	been more wrong. My first impression of the product was how well it
	was made. The rear cover of the router sits flush with the rest of
	the product. The matte black plastic body while not extremely solid,
	has enough quality to take day to day beating and lends the device a
	minimalist yet smart look.</p>

	<p>The first thing I did after getting the device was changing the
	password for the WiFi connection. I promptly logged into the device
	configuration page (192.168.225.1) where the first suprise awaited
	me. Beneath a title ODM, the text Foxconn was written. So the device
	was manufactured by Foxconn :D Thus the good initial impresssion.</p>

	<p>Fast forward a few hours, I was trying to study something and
	became bored. I have a habit of running nmap on new devices I buy,
	hoping to find something interesting. Also, OS detection feature in
	nmap helps me to find what OS the device is running. I suddenly
	remembered I had failed to do so, with JioFi. This is what a basic
	nmap scan returned:</p>

	<p class="code">
		aswin@ThinkPad-L440:~$ nmap 192.168.225.1<br>
		<br>
		Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-09-21 21:06 IST<br>
		Nmap scan report for jiofi.local.html (192.168.225.1)<br>
		Host is up (0.013s latency).<br>
		Not shown: 996 closed ports<br>
		PORT     STATE SERVICE<br>
		53/tcp   open  domain<br>
		80/tcp   open  http<br>
		6666/tcp open  irc<br>
		7777/tcp open  cbt<br>
		<br>
		Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.44 seconds<br>
	</p>

	<p>Lets start with the crown jewel. Why the heck is a 4G enabled
	WifiRouter running an IRC server on port 6666?</p>

	<p>There is a DNS server running on port 53 :) which is an okay if
	not welcome addition. The device must be doing some DNS caching to
	speed up webpage load performance</p>

	<p>On port 80, we have the web server running our configuration
	interface. That is as typical as it gets, but what is not typical
	is the service that listens on port 7777 nmap tells me that the
	service running on the port is cbt, which usually means it is
	running an Oracle HTTP server. Okay. But seriously, why?</p>

	<p>Trying to detect the OS, nmap gives me the following results:</p>

	<p class="code">
		Running: Linux 3.X|4.X<br>
		OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:3 cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:4<br>
		OS details: Linux 3.2 - 4.6<br>
	</p>

	<p>It is running a comparitively newer version of the Linux kernel.
	Embedded devices usually suck in this regard. My D-Link router still
	runs on the ancient 2.6 kernel.</p>

	<p>It is very early to jump into any conclusions. But apparently,
	the JioFi router is running a number of services that is not 
	essential for it to function. I will continue to poke into the
	device and will update it if I find anything interesting…</p>
