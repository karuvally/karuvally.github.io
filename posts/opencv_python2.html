    <h1>Setting up OpenCV with Python 2</h1>
    
	<p>The first time I tried to use OpenCV on my computer, I had to
	download the sources of lots of libraries and had to spend the next
	12 hours figuring out how to compile them and then get the whole
	thing to work with Python. Thankfully, a person now trying to use
	OpenCV now does not have to go through the same ordeal. This is
	because, precompiled libraries called wheels are now available for
	easy installation of OpenCV. In this post, I will show you how.</p>

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>First of all, make sure your distro is still supported. Linux
	distributions after the end of their release cycle usually do not
	allow installing softwares from repositories. That is, you would
	not be able to use your package manager to install software. So be
	sure to have a “recent” Linux distribution.
	Lets start by updating your list of packages</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ sudo apt-get update  
	</p>

	<p>With this post, we are dealing with the Python 2 side of things.
	so make sure it is installed. On Debian derivatives, you can just
	do</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ sudo apt-get install python  
	</p>

	<p>If you are on fedora,</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ sudo dnf install python27  
	</p>

	<p>Once that is out of our way, we need to install the Python
	package manager, pip. On Debian derivatives, do</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
	</p>

	<p>On fedora, you can do</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ sudo dnf install python-pip
	</p>
	<p>Now we proceed to install Virtualenv.</p>

	<h2>Setting up Virtualenv</h2>
	<p>Virtualenv is a container inside which you can set a Python
	environment complete with libraries which is independent from the
	rest of the system. Setting up Virtualenv is worth it, as it won’t
	interfere with the rest of your system and will continue to work
	after a distro hop. Now that we have pip on our system, installating
	Virtualenv is as easy.</p>

	<p>On fedora, do</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ sudo dnf install python2-virtualenv 
	</p>

	<p>If you are on Debian, do</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
	</p>

	<p>Once installed, go to someplace where you want to keep the files
	for your project. Create a directory for the same and initialize a
	virtualenv inside the directory. It is done as follows.</p>

	<p class="code">
		$ mkdir opencv  
		$ cd opencv  
		$ virtualenv . -p python2 
	</p>

	<p>To make a virtualenv work for us, we need to activate it. This is
	done by calling the activate script.</p>

	<p class="code">
		$ source bin/activate  
	</p>

	<p>Once this is properly done, your prompt should change to
	something that resembles</p>
	<p class="code">
		(opencv) $  
	</p>
	<p>Okay. Thats it. Lets move on.</p>

	<h2>Installing the libraries</h2>
	<p>Now we address the elephant in the room. Let us setup OpenCV and
	some of the essential packages to make it work for us.</p>
	<p class="code">$
		pip install opencv-contrib-python # the OpenCV package<br>
		$ pip install imutils               # convinience functions<br>
		$ pip install matplotlib            # easily plot the resultant images<br>
		$ pip install jupyter               # easy, powerful programming environment<br>
		$ pip install numpy                 # for managing all those image arrays<br>
	</p>

	<h2>Lets code!</h2>
	<p>If you want an easy to use programming environment for learning
	OpenCV, you just installed it. We are ofcourse, talking about
	Jupyter Notebook. To start, do</p>
	<p class="code">
		(opencv) $ jupyter notebook  
	</p>

	<p>Some easy examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/karuvally/cv_workshop">here</a>.
	Once you are done coding, you can quit by presssing “Ctrl + C”, then
	deactivate Virtualenv by running “deactivate” command</p>
	<p class="code">
		(opencv) $ deactivate
	</p>
