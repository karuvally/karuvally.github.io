    <h1>Fixing unbearably slow Firefox startup</h1>

    <p>I use Firefox.<br>
    I trust them more than the Google folks (quite meaningless coming from a
    person who use almost all of Google's services). But more importantly, I
    feel it is an act of defiance. I really don't want the power to decide
    the web standards to be left to Google alone.</p>

    <p>But it has a problem. The first time you install and start using
    firefox, it starts up in a jiffy, maybe even faster than Chrome. But some
    time into usage, you might suddenly realize that the startup has become so
    slow that it is almost unusable.</p>
