    <h1>Some very useful *NIX tools</h1>

	<p>Linux has no dearth of tools for getting your tasks done. The
	actual problem is the proliferation of packages that can make it
	hard for finding the  right tools for the job. Once in a while you
	come across a gem that makes your life a whole lot easier. Below is
	a list of gems I collected along my journey through Linux. Hope it
	will serve you as well.</p>

	<p>Midnight Commander [mc]<br>

	interface Supports FTP, SSHFS, provides you with plethora of options
	for tweaking and still starts under half a second.</p>
