    <h1>Setting up OpenCV with Python 3</h1>
    
    <p>Things change. Half an year ago, I was happy with running OpenCV
    on Python 2. But not anymore. As hard as it is for me to admit, it
    is time to switch to Python 3. So here is my supposedly easy to
    follow tutorial on setting up OpenCV on Python 3.</p>
    
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>First of all, get the latest package listings from the repository.
    If you are on fedora, you can safely skip this. If you are on Debian,
    do the following.</p>
    <p class="code">
		$ sudo apt-get update
	</p>
    
    <p>Lets make sure Python 3 and its dev libs are installed. If on
    Debian, run</p>
    <p class="code">
		$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev
	</p>
	
	<p>If you are on fedora,</p>
    <p class="code">
		$ sudo dnf install python3 python3-devel
	</p>
	
	<p>Now, let us install the python package manager, more commonly
	called pip. On Debian, you would want to do this,</p>
    <p class="code">
		sudo apt-get install python3-pip
	</p>
	
	<p>On fedora, you can do</p>
    <p class="code">
		$ sudo dnf install python3-pip
	</p>
	<p>Now we can proceed to install VirtualEnv.</p>
	
	<p>Virtualenv is a container inside which you can set a Python
	environment complete with libraries which is independent from the
	rest of the system. Setting up Virtualenv is worth it, as it allows
	us to maintain multiple versions of libraries parallely without
	conflicts.</p>
	
	<p>On fedora, do</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ sudo dnf install python3-virtualenv 
	</p>
	
	<p>If you are on Debian, do</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ sudo apt-get install python3-venv
	</p>
	
	<p>Once installed, go to someplace where you want to keep the files
	for your project. Create a directory for the same and initialize a
	virtualenv inside the directory. It can be done as follows</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ mkdir opencv<br>
		$ cd opencv<br>
		$ python3 -m venv .<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>To make a virtualenv work for us, we need to activate it.
	This is done by calling the activate script.</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ source bin/activate  
	</p>
	
	<p>Once this is properly done, your prompt should change to
	something that resembles</p>
	<p class="code">
		(opencv) $
	</p>
	<p>That should do it. Let us install the libraries.</p>
	
	<h2>Installing the libraries</h2>
	<p>Now we address the elephant in the room. Let us setup OpenCV and
	some of the essential packages to make it work for us.</p>
	<p class="code">
		$ pip install opencv-contrib-python # the OpenCV package<br>
		$ pip install imutils               # convinience functions<br> 
		$ pip install matplotlib            # easily plot the resultant images<br>
		$ pip install jupyter               # easy, powerful programming environment<br>
		$ pip install numpy                 # for managing all those image arrays<br>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Let's code!</h2>
	<p>If you want an easy to use programming environment for learning
	OpenCV, you just installed it. We are ofcourse, talking about Jupyter
	Notebook. To start, do</p>
	<p class="code">(opencv) $ jupyter notebook</p>
	
	<p>As always, once you are done coding, you can quit by presssing
	“Ctrl + C”, then deactivate Virtualenv by running “deactivate”
	command</p>
	<p class="code">
		(opencv) $ deactivate
	</p></p>
