    <h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>Hi, I am Aswin. Lover of computers, *NIX, autos and all things
	tech. I program, read, teach and does some basic I/O when bored. This
	is my memory dump for all good people to see :)</p>

	<h2>What do you do?</h2>
	<p>I tweak my Linux box, try to get better at programming, lust at
	old hardware, cars and spends a good deal of time thinking. I am
	also trying to earn my daily bread by working for a company called
	XILINX. By the way, everything I say in this blog is from my personal
	opinion and is in no way related to XILINX.</p>

	<h2>What programming languages do you use?</h2>
	<p>Anything that makes me happy :D
	<br>Python and C are favorites, but sadly I still remain a newbie at
	C (working hard to fix this by the way!)</p>

	<h2>Which OS do you use?</h2>
	<p>Originally, I tended to use lots and lots of Linux with Windows
	thrown in occasionally, when I felt I needed a break. My current job
	requires me to use a Windows laptop to connect to the UNIX virtual
	machines, where the actual work is done. Yup. Not very cool.</p>

	<h2>Who designed this blog</h2>
	<p>This blog was designed from scratch using plain old HTML and CSS.
	It was heavily inspired by <a href="http://danluu.com/">Dan Luu's</a>
	and <a href="https://unixsheikh.com">UNIX Sheikh's</a> blogs
	Please feel free to re-use any styling elements if you feel they are
	good enough!</p>

	<h2>Can you be hired?</h2>
	<p>Maybe! take a look at my
